In "Session_X" folder must be :

    - "Session_X_participants_database.csv" : 
    	* Each column header represents a parameter that will need to be filled for every participant. This file is read when the session
	is launched and the interface is populated with entries for every paramater found in the file. This file must be modified according 
	to the data you need to manually collect for each participant.
    - "Session_X_participants_pseudos_database.csv" :
    	* Stores the pseudo generated by the interface for each participant. This file should be modified by hand only to erase a participant, as a void 
    	file is generated (with the required column headers) if it is not present in this folder when the interface is launched.
    - "Session_X_experimental_parameters.csv" :
    	* This file contains a line for each parameter of the experiment which is composed, first, of the label of the parameter and then of a list of 
    	values the parameter must be drawn from to make up a trial. Example : If the participant is expected to reach for a given object with a given hand,
    	this file should be :  
    		hand ; right ; left
    		object ; object_a ; object_b
    - "Session_X_recording_parameters.csv" : 
    	* This file contains the parameters that define the recording process of your experiment.  Example : camera resolution, fps...
    - "Session_X_instructions_languages.csv" : 
    	* This file is used for the display of intructions to the participant about the task they need to perform for a given trial. It contains the 
    	translation of each parameter value in french and english, as well as their introduction sentences if needed (! code may need modifications to 
    	handle your intros. The translation may be provided either by modifying this file or via the interface when employed for the first time
    - "Session_X_processing_monitoring.csv"
    	* This file keeps track of the recording and (if applicable) of the processing phases of your experiment, for each participant
